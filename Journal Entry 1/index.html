        <h1>What is a Website Anyway?</h1>

    <!--fist stanza-->
        <br><h3>From my knowledge of technology prior to this course and from what I have learned in the last few weeks, a website is a hub for an idea to <span class="bold">live, breathe, and expand</span> to human beings.</h3>
        <p>Like a <b>book</b>, a website stores information, information that can be beneficial to people, harmful to people, add value or take it away. Websites get people to think differently, and I would argue, <b>more creatively</b>. They offer the space to distribute knowledge in a methodology that is specifically curtailed to the way our minds work, what we pay most attention to, and what captures our interests the most.</p>
        <p>The strength of use of the internet comes from the way we are able to design websites. Unlike books that are organized by chapters, and have a more common structure to order information and tell stories, the internet has created <b>unique and innovational</b> ways to tell stories and to alter the fundamentals of how we seek information and pass it on to others.</p>




    <!--Second stanza-->
        <h3>Maybe one day the internet won't have the same <span class="bold">importance or impact</span> that it does today.</h3>
        <p> As technology continues to grow and shift with the world, I am sure websites will become an outdated concept, and we will have new means of acquiring and distributing ideas and information. The negatives I feel from the internet as someone who grew up with major shifts in technology is the fact that it is supposed to make people <b>more connected</b>, but it seems to have done the exact opposite. Maybe websites or the internet generally arenâ€™t to blame for this issue, but what has come from this creation, like smart phones and social media, have taken away some of the <b>value</b> and <b>identity</b> of what it is to be a human being and feel connected to other human beings.</p>
        <h3>My hopes is that as we move forward to whatever innovation in tech comes next, we <span class="bold">think backwards</span> to what gave us some of that more <span class="bold">meaningful connection</span> in the past while still allowing for creativity to grow and blossom.</h3>
