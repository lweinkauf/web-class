        <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
        <p> In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.</p>
        <p>In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.</p>
        <p>Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.**</p>

     <h6><span class="bold">QUOTE THAT INSPIRES ME TO DREAM BIG :</span> “At twenty-four I did have a Crazy Idea, and somehow, despite being dizzy with existential angst, and fears about the future, and doubts about myself, as all young men and women in their mid twenties are, I did decide that the world is made up of crazy ideas. History is one long processional of crazy ideas. The things I loved most—books, sports, democracy, free ​enterprise—started as crazy ideas.”</h6>

        <h6><span class="bold">QUOTE THAT I READ BEFORE I RUN :</span> "People reflexively assume that competition is always a good thing, that it always brings out the best in people, but that’s only true of people who can forget the competition. The art of competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting, and I now reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. You must forget that internal voice screaming, begging, “Not one more step!” And when it’s not possible to forget it, you must negotiate with it.”</h6>

        <h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
        <p>What drew me to the story of Phil Knight and the reason that it is my favorite book is the <span class="bold">CONTAGIOUS ENERGY</span> of Knight and his <span class="bold">DRIVE TO ACHIEVE</span>. As an athlete growing up, and someone who is passionate about running, hearing Knight’s <span class="bold">RELENTLESS DRIVE AND DETERMINATION</span> to create a business that spoke to the spirit of athletics was nothing short of inspiring. Phil Knight went the extra mile every time to create a brand that wasn’t about a shoe or any other product, but rather a feeling and a community of athletes rallied behind a love for sports.</p>

         <h6>“Shoe Dog is a great American story about luck, grit, know-how, and the magic alchemy of a handful of eccentric characters who came together to build Nike. That it happened at all is a miracle, because as I learned from this book, though we are a nation that extols free enterprise, we also excel thwarting it. The lessons Phil Knight imparts about entrepreneurship and the obstacles one faces in trying to create something are priceless. The pages I folded down are too many to mention." -ABRAHAM VERGHESE, New York Times bestselling author of Cutting for Stone</h6>

            <h6>“I've known Phil Knight since I was a kid, but I didn't really know him until I opened this beautiful, startling, intimate book. And the same goes for Nike. I've worn the gear with pride, but I didn't realize the remarkable saga of innovation and survival and triumph that stood behind every swoosh. Candid, funny, suspenseful, literary-this is a memoir for people who love sport, but above all it's a memoir for people who love memoirs.” -ANDRE AGASSI, New York Times bestselling author of Open</h6>
