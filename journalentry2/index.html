    <h1>Web Design Journal Entry 2</h1>
    <h2>In reflecting on Frank Chimero’s “The Web’s Grain” I have a new perspective on web design, specifically reflexive design, and the limitless borders and possibilities that are the internet.</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The way Chimero talks about website design today, and our natural instinct as designers to<span class="important"> break things down to fit into a box</span> is the way I would have thought about design originally. I think as we get older and are told what creative rules you’re supposed to follow, we <span class="important">consequently give our mind creative limitations.</span> Rules suffocate us and take away our brains ability to think outside of typical bounds and give us all a baseline for the way we design, and the same frame of mind in how we approach things. For example, if learning how to draw a rectangle when growing up, you probably want all the sides to be straight and smooth, you know that parallel sides are supposed to be equal, and it would likely resemble something like this box that our text is in, but before we teach ourselves what the square is supposed to look like, the possibilities are endless, the ideas are endless, and the confines don't exist.</p>
      
      <p>There’s so much to learn in creative thinking from children who either don't have the rules yet ingrained in their head or choose not to consider them yet. I think taking the approach to responsive design to start from the contents and build the frame around it is a creative and smart challenge for designers to expand capabilities and commonalities that we see in website structures today.</p>
      
      <p>Overall Chimero inspired me to think in a non-traditional about the way I should design or create, and to know <span class="important">bounds are endless</span>, especially once we choose to <span class="important">forget about the mental ones we have constructed.</span></p>
