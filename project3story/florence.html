    <h3>Chapter 7. Florence</h3>
    <p>Florence was my first trip traveling alone to visit my best friend Jake from high school. Jake and I have been friends since 6th grade so I was very excited to go see him and what it was like studying and living in Florence for a few days. This trip was a breath of fresh air. Florence is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and I really appreciated the fact that you could see and explore all of it on foot. I spent a lot of time there in complete awe, wandering around the park and sitting on the side of a hill that overlooked the city. Florence was simply a trance.
