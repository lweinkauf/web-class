    <h3>Chapter 8. Dubrovnik</h3>
    <p>Dubrovnik was one of the final trips of the semester and will always be so special to me. I canâ€™t put into words how beautiful of a place this was, with so much character and history as well as the most blue water I've ever seen hidden at the end of every corner. Walking around Dubrovnik was the most at peace I felt the entire time I was in Europe, making it all the more difficult to think about leaving for the summer. Alas, all good things must come to an end, as did the crazy wonderful exhausting perfect life-changing experience that was abroad. Months later I still have a hard time comprehending or making sense of my luck to be able to travel to so many incredible cities with the most amazing friends by my side. Until we meet again Europe! The end for now....
