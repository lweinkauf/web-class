    <h3>Chapter 1. London</h3>
    <p>London was my home from the months of January 2023 to May 2023. I had no idea what to expect when coming in, all I knew to be prepared for was rain. London was the place that helped my transition from child to adult. Who I was before living in London and who I came out after are two completely different individuals. I became more confident, independent, free-spirited, and open-minded. I fell completely in love with the city, something captivating me at every corner. I will forever be incredibly thankful for this place, for the people I met, relationships I built, places I traveled to, and friends who became family. 
    </p>
     <h3><br>Highlights</h3>
     <p>1. My Art and Architecture class that gave me the opportunity to go to many of London's museums and travel around new areas of the city
        <br>2. The week my parents visited and taking them to Brighton and Seven Sisters Country Park
        <br>3. Living with my 5 best friends in a really sweet area of London near campus called Clerkenwell, my favorite street in the city will always be Exmouth Market, a block around the corner from our apartment full of charming small restraunts, shops, and people.
