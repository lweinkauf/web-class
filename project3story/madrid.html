    <h3>Chapter 3. Madrid</h3>
    <p>
        Madrid was one of the most fun cities we went to. From rooftops at sunset to experiencing a Real Madrid game, the energy in Madrid was contagious. The highlights of the trip for me came from time spent away from the big group just appreciating the beauty of the city. One of these moments came from walking around Retiro park and watching people boat around the lake. I also went to watch the sunset from one of Madridâ€™s famous view points. There were lots of groups of people picnicking and drinking wine, some who I chatted with, realizing how bad my spanish has gotten over the last few years.
