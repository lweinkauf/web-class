    <h3>Chapter 2. Rome</h3>
    <p>Rome was the first place outside of London that my friends traveled to as a group during our time in Europe. We were going to visit a few people from Fordham who were studying there so we invited some of our guy friends, which was the start of a group of 12 of us becoming extremely close and going everywhere together. I remember waking up at 4:30 in the morning to walk to the train that brought us to the airport, the anxiety I had about my second flight without my parents, and the anticipation for my first time in Italy. Whenever I look back on this trip I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude. I had the opportunity to go to the Vatican, inside the Sistine Chapel, see the Colosseum, make a wish at the Trevi Fountain and walk circles around the city of Rome. This trip wasnâ€™t only special from what I saw, but from the time spent with all my friends, playing the number game in the airport, checking in on each other when we were bored on the flight, squeezing 4 people on an air matress, dancing in the kitchen, and late conversations on the balcony into the night. It was peacful to feel at home so far away from New York.
