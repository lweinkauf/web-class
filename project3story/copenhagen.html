    <h3>Chapter 4. Copenhagen</h3>
    <p>
        The weekend we went to Copenhagen was my 21st birthday so this trip will always be particularly special when looking back on. The people in Copenhagen were as beautiful and kind as it gets and the scenery was out of a fairytale. I remember biking around the city with one of my best friends Peter, and the sweet waiter at my birthday dinner. I remember my friends singing happy birthday to me. I remember walking an unnecessary amount to find the trampoline sidewalk my friends had seen online and bouncing with a little girl, her smile was contagious. I remember climbing what felt like a million steps of a tower that ended up giving us a view of the whole city at sunset (worth it). I remember feeling so appreciative for my friends and loved on this trip.
