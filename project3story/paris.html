    <h3>Chapter 5. Paris</h3>
    <p> The city of love! Boy did I enjoy this trip. Fordham took all of the students in Gabelli to Paris which meant we stayed in a beautiful hotel with the majority of students in the grade and took the train to get there. I will never forget how good it felt to crawl under the fresh sheets after walking around in the rain our first day. I had been to Paris once before with my family and I loved it just as much, if not more, the second time. Something about the french language and the architecture of the city is so beautiful, and I felt refreshed when wandering around the city. When my friends and I talk about our favorite moment abroad, I always go back to this trip and think about the dinner boat cruise the school took us on. I sat next to the window taking turns drooling over the eiffel tower, watching conversations between students and friends at other tables with the Fordham London staff, and smiling at the woman who serenading us through dinner. I kept grabbing the friend sitting next to me, beaming that this was real life.
