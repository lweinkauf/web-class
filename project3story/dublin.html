    <h3>Chapter 6. Dublin</h3>
    <p>Dublin was the end to a manic spring break, and to continue the mania was St. Patrick's day! I loved every second spent in Dublin. This trip was essentially the reunion of American college students studying abroad and pretending to be Irish for the weekend. Normally, this would've be something I would avoid, but I chose to embrace the moment and ended up having a really great time. Three of my best friends from high school were also in Ireland as were at least 3 friends of each of my 12 friends on the trip with me, meaning I met a LOT of people. I always love meeting friends of friends, it explains so much about them and how they grew up. I also see a new glimpse in their personalities come out every time. To make a long story short, I probably spent 97% of this trip in pubs laughing, singing, and enjoying the intersection of my American friends with the Irish and the spirit of St. Pattyâ€™s day.
