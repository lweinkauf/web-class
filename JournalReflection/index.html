        <div class="div1-text">Why I took Web Design - This past summer I interned in a marketing role and a common theme that was drilled into my brain throughout the entirety of the program was the importance of technology and advantages of knowing how to code. I've always wanted to have a career that is creative in some aspect, so when I saw the class description for Web Design, a class that would help me gain some exposure to tech/coding but also staying in the world I am comfortable and familiar with creatively made perfect sense.</div>
        <div class="div2-text">Expectation to Reality - I didn’t know what to expect when coming in, whether or not I would actually enjoy the technical skills and tediousness that is coding, or what kind of work we would be doing. I am happy to say that I have gained so much from being a part of this class and have found that I do really enjoy the coding itself, so much so that I am taking a python course next semester. I have grown significantly from my first exercise to the final project that I am working on now, and I can attribute that to the style of the course and way it was taught: repeating concepts and doing demonstrations in class that could directly apply on our own.</div>
        <div class="div3-text">
            Classroom Environment - I've also gained so much from my peers! Every time a student presented one of our projects I found myself making mental notes of ways they utilized different skills, styles, or general creative choices that I was so impressed with. It’s also equally if not more important to be able to speak on the behalf of your work as it is to develop it, and I feel that I have gained a better understanding of my own design process through having to share it with the group. Additionally, through readings and topics about technology and the history of the web, I have a new and better understanding of how we got to where we are now, and what the future may look like in terms of tech.</div>
        <div class="div4-text">
            Thank you! Web Design may be my favorite class that I have taken in my four years at Fordham, not only from what I have learned about general coding and am capable of creating now, but even more so from the group of students who were a part of it and what we have gained from bringing our own design taste to the table every week. Thank you Professor Belen for an amazing semester!</div>
